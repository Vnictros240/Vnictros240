# 👋 Hey, I'm **Victor Sullivan**

**Network Engineer → Cybersecurity Practitioner → Red Team & Offensive Security Learner**

I’m a security-minded Network Engineer with 10+ years of experience designing and supporting complex Cisco-based architectures across manufacturing, healthcare, and enterprise environments.  

Today, I’m focused on advancing into **Offensive Security**, **Red Team tradecraft**, and **applied security engineering**—building tools, writing labs, documenting research, and sharpening adversarial thinking.

My background gives me a strong foundation in:
- Network security architecture  
- Secure remote access (IPSec, DMVPN, VPN topologies)  
- Segmentation & high-availability design  
- Vulnerability analysis & structured triage  
- Python automation and configuration auditing  
- SIEM-based investigation & signal extraction  

I’m currently building a public body of work in:
- Web application penetration testing  
- Network penetration testing & exploitation  
- Red Team methodology & reporting  
- Threat modeling & adversarial exercises  
- AI-assisted offensive tooling (Python + GPT workflows)  

---

## 🔥 Current Focus

- **Red Team & Offensive Security skills development**  
- **Hands-on labs** (Web, API, Network, Cloud)  
- **Python tooling** for reconnaissance, automation, parsing, and reporting  
- Improving methodology around **signal vs noise**, recon workflows, and exploit validation  
- Structured write-ups for learning, clarity, and public knowledge sharing

## 🧰 Tech & Tools

**Networking:** Cisco IOS/NX-OS, VLANs, ACLs, DMVPN, IPSec, OSPF, BGP  
**Pentesting:** Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, FFUF, SQLMap  
**Security:** NIST CSF, SIEM (Azure Sentinel), log analysis, hardening  
**Scripting:** Python, Bash  
**Automation:** Ansible Tower, GitHub Actions  
**Operating Systems:** Linux, Ubuntu Server, Windows  
**Cloud:** Azure (Foundational)  
**Other Interests:** ICS/OT security fundamentals (early learning phase)
